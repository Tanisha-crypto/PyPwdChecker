# Password Strength Checker

A simple yet effective password strength checker built with Python and Tkinter. This application evaluates your passwords based on security criteria and provides real-time feedback.

## Features

- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant password strength evaluation
- **Color-Coded Results**: 
  - 🟢 Green for Strong passwords
  - 🟠 Orange for Medium strength passwords
  - 🔴 Red for Weak passwords
- **Security Criteria**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*...)

## Password Strength Levels

### Strong
- Meets all security criteria
- Password is considered secure

### Medium
- Missing special characters
- Add special characters for better security

### Weak
- Fails one or more security criteria
- Must meet all requirements for a secure password

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd PyPwdChecker
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The GUI window will open with the following elements:
- **Password Input Field**: Enter your password (displayed as dots for security)
- **Check Strength Button**: Click to evaluate your password
- **Clear Button**: Reset the fields for a new check
- **Result Display**: Shows the password strength assessment
- **Criteria Display**: Reference guide for password requirements

## How to Use

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`
2. Enter your password in the text field
3. Click the "Check Strength" button
4. View the result:
   - **Green text** = Strong password ✓
   - **Orange text** = Medium strength (add special characters)
   - **Red text** = Weak password (needs improvement)
5. Use the "Clear" button to try another password

## Security Notes

- Your password is **never stored** or **transmitted**
- All checks are performed locally on your computer
- The password display is masked with asterisks (*)

## Building an Executable

This project can be compiled into a standalone executable using PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller main.py --onefile --windowed --name PasswordChecker
```

This will create a standalone `.exe` file in the `dist` folder that can be run without Python installed.

## Example Passwords

### Strong Passwords ✓
- `SecurePass123!`
- `MyP@ssw0rd2024`
- `Coding#Expert99`

### Medium Passwords ~
- `SecurePass123` (missing special character)
- `MyPassword2024` (missing special character)

### Weak Passwords ✗
- `password` (too short, no uppercase/digit/special)
- `Pass123` (too short, no special character)
- `PASSWORD` (no lowercase, digit, or special)
- `12345678` (no letters or special characters)

## Tips for Strong Passwords

1. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
2. Include numbers at different positions, not just at the end
3. Add special characters like !@#$%^&*
4. Avoid dictionary words and common phrases
5. Don't use personal information (birthdate, names, etc.)
6. Make it at least 12 characters for better security
7. Use unique passwords for different accounts

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Regular Expressions**: Used for special character validation
- **Code Style**: Clean, readable, and well-commented
